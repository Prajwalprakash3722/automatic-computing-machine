# Accounts

### This is a Account Maintaining System for IEEE RVCE SB.

#### As of now we have following features:

- Login
- Add new Transaction
- Edit Transaction
- Automatically Calculating the Amount Spent and Amount Remaining based on opening balance and transactions
- Graphical Representation of the Amount Spent by each societies
- Generating the PDF Report of the Transactions
- Generating the CSV Report of the Transactions

#### To be Done

- Split report generating into quarters
- Automatically mailing the expense report to EXECOM and the respective societies at the end of each month
- Enable the Society to add their own transactions, ofc they won't have access to the main Accounts
- Make the application to be easily handed over to the next peep

#### Critical Section

- As of now we are hardcoding the opening balance, if anyone has a better idea please feel free to suggest.
